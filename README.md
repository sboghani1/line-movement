# Line Movement - Fade Finder

Automated betting pick tracker with Discord integration, ESPN schedules, and odds polling.

## 🎯 What This Does

1. **Discord picks** → OCR/parse pick images → Google Sheets + GitHub Pages
2. **ESPN schedules** → Daily NBA/CBB/NHL game schedules for pick validation
3. **Odds polling** → Track line movement from The Odds API
4. **Static website** → Fade Finder React app showing capper consensus

### Core Scripts (GitHub Actions automation)
| File | Workflow | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `capper_analyzer.py` | Every 15 min | Main script: fetch Discord images, OCR with Claude, parse picks, finalize with schedule matching, append to Google Sheets + local CSV. Also runs `daily_audit.py` at the end of each nightly invocation. |

## 🩺 Audit Results Review Process

When rows appear in `audit_results`, group by pattern using `check_failed` + `details`, then write a new check in `daily_audit.py`:

```bash
python daily_audit.py --dry-run --date YYYY-MM-DD   # verify against past affected dates
python daily_audit.py --date YYYY-MM-DD              # apply — fixes master_sheet, upgrades
                                                     # needs_review rows to auto_fixed, syncs CSV
```

### Fix log

| Date | Issue | PR |
|------|-------|----|
| 2026-03-21 | Advance pick dates — cappers post picks the night before; Stage 2 searched wrong date's schedule, leaving `game` empty | #14 |

## 🛠 TODO

- [ ] **Populate `result` column**: Build a script that looks up game outcomes and fills the `result` column (W/L/Push) in `master_sheet` and `parsed_picks_new`.

- [ ] **Audit report**: After the nightly Opus audit runs, generate a next-day manual review report (written to a `audit_report` sheet or Discord message) containing:
  - `num_rows_audit_pass` — picks that passed all 4 passes cleanly
  - `num_rows_audit_warn` — Pass 3 suspects cleared by Opus (false positives)
  - `num_rows_audit_fail` — confirmed hallucinations written to `audit_results`
  - Full details for warns and failures: date, capper, pick, line, OCR snippet, Opus verdict

- [ ] **Opus predictor**: Before picks come in each day, use Opus to analyze the day's schedule (NBA/CBB/NHL games) and identify high-value spots to watch — e.g. public fade candidates, line value based on historical capper tendencies, noteworthy matchups. Output posted somewhere visible (Discord, `predictions` sheet, or GitHub Pages) so you have context before reviewing the day's picks.

## 🔬 Refactoring Plan: Fix Spread & Shorten Prompts

### The Big Idea

Claude's only truly irreplaceable job in Stage 2 is **abbreviation resolution** — mapping OCR shorthand like "OKC", "BKN", "CBJ" to full team names. Everything else can be pure Python:

- **Game matching**: Given a full team name + date + sport, Python already does this perfectly in `populate_stage2.py` via `team_matches()`
- **Spread lookup**: Python reads it directly from the schedule sheet (already working in `populate_stage2.py` and `finalize_picks.py`)
- **Side**: Removed entirely — it was just a copy of `pick` and nothing depended on it

The abbreviation space is finite (30 NBA + 32 NHL + ~362 CBB teams, each with a small set of common aliases). On any given day only ~15-30 teams are playing, so the search space is tiny. A maintained alias mapping in a Google Sheet can replace Claude for this task.

### Phase 1: Remove `side` column ✅ Done

Remove the `side` column entirely from code, Google Sheets, and CSV. It is just a copy of `pick` — the dashboard already falls back to `pick`, and `populate_results.py` doesn't use it.

- Remove `side` from all column headers/constants across every file
- Shift column indices (result moves from index 8 → 7, etc.)
- Update dashboard (`index.html`) to use `pick` directly instead of `side` with fallback
- Remove `side` from `daily_audit.py`: `check_next_day_game` updates, `side_consistency` check spec, `REQUIRED_COLUMNS`
- Remove `side` from `validate_and_fix_pick_column()`
- Remove `side` from `populate_stage2.py`
- Delete `side` column from Google Sheets and CSV

### Phase 2: Move spread to Python schedule lookup ✅ Done

Removed spread from Claude's Stage 2 prompt — it now only fills `game` and `side`. A Python post-pass looks up the consensus spread directly from the ESPN schedule sheets.

- `capper_analyzer.py`: Added `lookup_spread_from_schedule()` helper; both `run_stage2()` and manual queue Stage 2 now fill spread via Python post-pass after Claude returns
- `build_stage2_prompt()`: Removed spread instructions — Claude told to leave spread empty
- `daily_audit.py`: `load_schedule_for_date()` now returns `(away, home, spread)` tuples; `check_next_day_game()` uses schedule spread instead of constructing `"{pick} {line}"`
- `spread_consistency` check spec updated: spread should match schedule, not `"{pick} {line}"`
- `format_schedule_for_prompt()` already omitted spread (no change needed)
- Example rows updated to show empty spread column (filled by Python)

### Phase 3: Backfill existing data

- Fix spread values in `master_sheet` for all non-ML rows where spread ≠ schedule spread
- Deduplicate the 18 known duplicate composite key pairs
- Validate match rate of Python resolver against all historical `parsed_picks_new` data before going live

### Phase 4: Eliminate Claude from Stage 2

Replace Claude Stage 2 entirely with Python regex + abbreviation mapping.

- Create `team_aliases` Google Sheet with columns: `abbreviation`, `full_name`, `sport`
- Pre-populate with known abbreviations from existing prompts + `_NOISE` regex in `populate_stage2.py`
- Build `resolve_team_name(pick_text, sport, date, schedules, aliases)`:
  - Try exact match against scheduled teams for that date/sport
  - Try substring match (existing `team_matches()` logic)
  - Try alias lookup from Google Sheet
  - If still no match, try other sports (existing wrong-sport detection)
  - Return `None` only if truly unresolvable
- Replace `build_stage2_prompt()` + Claude API call with this Python function
- Keep Claude Stage 1 as-is (OCR parsing genuinely needs LLM intelligence)
- For unresolvable picks: leave for manual review or fall back to lightweight Claude call
